# Flight-Track-App
  Java implementation of Flight Track App
  ## How It Works
  I used Swing for the GUI.<br />
  Multithereaded programming to control every flight individually.<br />
  Lastly I used event-driven programming techniques for all program.<br />
  
  ## First Frame (Flights Prepared)
  1- You can add new flights and you can update already occurs<br />
  2- You can delete the flights<br />
  3- You can add new capitals or delete existing capitals<br />
  Then you have to give a starting point for the simulation

  ## Second Frame (Simulation)
  Just start the simulation and follow the state column, then give permission if the flight asks for it.<br /> 
  1- You can set some delay the selected flight<br />
  2- You can cancel selecten flight<br />
  3- You can give permission if the flight asks for permission to land<br />
  4- You can start the similation time, pause the time and stop the time.<br />
